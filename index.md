# SCRUM 101

## A practical introduction to SCRUM and Agile software development

This website is addressed for all current and prospective SCRUM users. It will not only contain information on the reasons behind chosing SCRUM versus other techniques, but also information on how to use SCRUM using JIRA. It will contain very basic and step-by-step guide for starters together with tips for more profficient users, so that everyone can make the best of their efforts towards a goal product. Scrum offers freedom of implementation, it's easy to learn and use, and allows optimisation of the team's efficiency and efficacy, at the same time it takes into account fast changing environments and highly tight deadlines for product delivery. Welcome to a hopefully long and succesful journey using Scrum and JIRA.



### Vision Statement

We are building a website to provide information how to use scrum

We need to learn how to use scrum ourselves

We have been successful when we have released a website with lessons about SCRUM.
