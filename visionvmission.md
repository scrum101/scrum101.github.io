#What is the difference between a vision statement and a mission statement

This page covers what the difference is between a vision and mission statement and in what circumstances you might use them.

#What is a Vision Statement

A vision statement is a forward looking statement which defined the aims, focus areas and goals of a project.

#What is a Mission statement 

#Why give your team a vision or mission

Providing the team with a vision or goals for the project they are working on gives them an understanding of the aims of the project and gives them a framework to help prioritize their work on the basis of how close a particular task or feature is to meeting the vision or goals.

#Vision statements are suitable for new projects

New projects should get vision statements. These are forward looking statements which define the values for the project, its focus areas and what the projects current goals are

#Mission statements are suitable for legacy projects

Legacy projects are better defined using mission statements. These statements define current operational goals so are better for projects which are not necessarily adding new functionality but sustainability and scalability for the project need to be ensured.
