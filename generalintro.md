# General introduction to SCRUM

This website is addressed for all current and prospective SCRUM users. It will not only contain information on the reasons behind chosing SCRUM versus other techniques, but also information on how to use SCRUM using JIRA. It will contain very basic and step-by-step guide for starters together with tips for more profficient users, so that everyone can make the best of their efforts towards a goal product. Scrum offers freedom of implementation, it's easy to learn and use, and allows optimisation of the team's efficiency and efficacy, at the same time it takes into account fast changing environments and highly tight deadlines for product delivery. Welcome to a hopefully long and succesful journey using Scrum and JIRA.
